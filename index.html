                    <strong>My Journey: From Curiosity to Leadership in Technology</strong>
                </p>
                <h3>Berkeley: The First Milestone</h3>
                <p>
                    My love for computers began in high school when my dad brought home our first desktop. From that point on, I was hooked. At Berkeley, my passion for technology found its academic match. I dove into a challenging blend of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering courses. Classes like Business Communication and Financial Engineering broadened my perspective and equipped me with skills beyond coding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Berkeley wasn't just about academics; it was a melting pot of experiences. Whether it was playing soccer, enjoying Taro Milk Tea, or dining at Bongo Burger, I embraced campus life in all its diversity. By the time I graduated, I had walked 6,000 miles to and from campus. It was a physical and metaphorical journey that taught me resilience and the true value of hard work.
                </p>
                <h3>Intel: My First Real-world Classroom</h3>
                <p>
                    After Berkeley, I joined Intel as a Design Automation Engineer. It was there that I geeked out on transistor-level optimization and even published a study on Intel's Ivy Bridge architecture, involving all of its 5 billion transistors. I can say I was essentially Intel's first data scientist. My work on automating tools further solidified my love for solving complex technological problems.
                </p>
                <h3>A New Challenge: Grad School and SEADS</h3>
                <p>
                    Feeling the urge for a new challenge, I applied to grad school at UC Santa Cruz. My Master's thesis was on recommendation systems, which set the stage for a bigger endeavor: SEADS (Smart Energy Disaggregation System). Guided by my amazing advisor, Patric Mantey, I led a community of 120 students to build a system capable of handling millions of data points per second.
                </p>
                <h3>The Teacher and the Student</h3>
                <p>
                    My experience at UC Santa Cruz also opened the doors to academia. I became faculty for senior design classes and had the opportunity to mentor over 200 students. My startup, SEADS, even secured funding from the National Science Foundation, thanks to our groundbreaking work.
                </p>
                <h3>Accenture: A New Playground</h3>
                <p>
                    Joining Accenture's Liquid Studio, I was exposed to a plethora of projects. From developing robotic platforms for medical equipment transport in hospitals to asset tracking systems for large utility companies, my role was ever-evolving. Each project was a new challenge and an opportunity to apply my skills in novel ways.
                </p>
                <h3>AI2X: The Journey Continues</h3>
                <p>
                    Today, I run AI2X, a consultancy firm focused on integrating General AI into business operations. Initially geared towards healthcare IT automation, I've since broadened my scope, helping businesses adapt to the ever-changing technological landscape.
                </p>
                <h3>Lessons for the Road Ahead</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the most important lessons I've learned is to keep an open mind and never stop learning. The fundamentals—be it in coding, statistics, physics, or finance—are essential. But what truly adds color to the canvas of my career is my ability to adapt and follow my passions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I look towards the future, I carry with me the spirit of resilience and continuous learning, ready to walk another 6,000 miles if that's what the journey demands.
                </p>
